This app will help you identify both the native range of CWRs in Canada, and the extent of those speciesâ€™ ranges that are conserved ex situ in botanic gardens of Canadian CWRs. Botanical gardens can provide a unique role in both conserving CWRs while also educating the public on the importance of CWRs through their outreach and public engagement programs.
