# What are CWRs?
Crop wild relatives (CWRs) are plant species that are closely related to agricultural crops and provide important genetic resources for plant breeding (Castañeda-Álvarez et al., 2016). 


### Why is conservation of CWR important?
The conservation of these taxa is essential for maintaining agricultural sustainability in the face of climate change (Jarvis et al., 2008).

### What is the knowledge gap?
Despite the increasing importance of CWRs, large gaps in our knowledge of CWR taxonomy, geographic distribution, and representation in conservation systems still remain. These gaps impede the development of further conservation action plans as well as the potential use of CWRs for crop improvement (Khoury et al., 2013). 

### Is there a CWR inventory for Canada? 
Canada currently lacks a national CWR inventory. Consequently, Canadian national strategies do not have a baseline knowledge for guiding CWR conservation efforts. The work reflected in this app is a first step towards advancing the development of this inventory. 

### What role does Botanical Gardens play?
Botanical gardens can provide a unique role in both conserving CWRs while also educating the public on the importance of CWRs through their outreach and public engagement programs.
